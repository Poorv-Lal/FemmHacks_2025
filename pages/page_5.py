with st.container(border=True):
    st.header("Why are microplastics harmful?")
    st.write("Because microplastics are so small they can enter our body through eating, breathing, and even touching them. So we have found them throughout the human body in our blood, saliva, liver, kidneys, lungs, and even placentas. Microplastics in blood vessels are especially worrisome because they increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, inflammation, and blood clotting. Plus, microplastics are generally linked to an increase in the risk of cancer, immune system damage, reproductive problems, and even developmental delays in children.")

Some simple ways to limit your internation with microplastics are not using exfoliants with them, filtering your tap water, buying products with natural fibers instead of synthetic ones, using detergent or detergent sheets instead of tide pods, and making sure you recycle your plastics correctly so they do not break down into microplastics.")
